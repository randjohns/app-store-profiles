# app-store-profiles
profiles of apps on the Google Play and App Store

This project from the Dataquest.io platform involves analysis of engagement with apps in the major app storefronts according to category, reviews, and many other variables. If you are looking for a template for creating functions, indexing in python (without NumPy or pandas), use of loops, then this would be a good resource to draw on for some fundamental techniques in Python.

Enjoy!
